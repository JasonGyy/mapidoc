A nice **string** formula where the element amounts are normalized and without
specific element identities. For example, the formula_anonymous for SrTiO3
is ABC3. Unique species are arranged in order of increasing amounts and
assigned successive alphabet letters. This is useful for prototyping formulas.
For example, all stoichiometric perovskites have formula_anonymous ABC3.
